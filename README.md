# quicklook-gpx

This is a simple QuickLook plugin to browse [GPX](http://www.topografix.com/gpx) files.

### Customization

The plugin uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to render a map
preview using map tiles for Norway provided by The Norwegian Mapping
Authority, [Kartverket](http://kartverket.no/). To use different
background map tiles, edit `template.html` and change `ol.source.XYZ`.

### Installation Instructions

- Build the project in XCode by going to Product -> Archive. 
- Then click the **Exportâ€¦** button, and save to a folder.
- Copy the resulting file `Products/Library/QuickLook/quicklook-gpx.qlgenerator` to `~/Library/QuickLook/`.
  (You may need to create the QuickLook folder if it doesn't exist.)
- Finder may pick it up automatically, but if it doesn't, you can run `qlmanage -r` to reload the plugins.
